## **What it is**
    - a cli that allows you to delete past messages sent by you (containing a term) semi-automatically!
    - yeah that's pretty much it

## requirements
* [python](https://www.python.org/)
* Libraries (can be installed quickly later): colorama@0.4.6, Requests@2.32.3

## setup
1. cd into directory
3. pip install -r requirements.txt (if you have not already installed libraries)
4. py nosigma.py
5. (optional) set the variables at the top so it's easier to use without having to re-enter auth, id, etc (too lazy to save via json)
